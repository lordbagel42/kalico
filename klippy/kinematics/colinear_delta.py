# Code for handling the kinematics of colinear delta robots
#
# A colinear delta is two independent linear-delta mechanisms that share the
# same three physical (colinear) rails.  A "toolhead" delta (steppers a/b/c)
# positions the nozzle and a "bed" delta (steppers d/e/f) positions the build
# plate.  Each of the three vertical rails carries two carriages (one from each
# mechanism), which is why the rails are "colinear".
#
# The commanded coordinate P = (x, y, z) is the position of the nozzle relative
# to the part.  The two mechanisms share that motion (a "motion_split" fraction
# to the toolhead, the remainder to the bed) and the bed mechanism operates in
# a coordinate frame rotated about Z relative to the toolhead frame
# (secondary_rotation, 180 degrees for a typical colinear delta).  The relative
# geometry obeys
#
#     T_world - B_world = Rz(theta) * P
#
# where T_world / B_world are the toolhead / bed effector world positions.  The
# split assigns T_world = split*Rz(theta)*P and B_world = -(1-split)*Rz(theta)*P
# (up to constants fixed at homing), so each carriage runs a standard delta
# sphere solve on a fixed affine map of P.  See docs/Colinear_Delta.md and
# docs/developers/Colinear_Delta_Agent_Guide.md for the full derivation.
